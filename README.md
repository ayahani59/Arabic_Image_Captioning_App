## Workflow  

Hereâ€™s breakdown of the application system:  

1. **Input Image**: User uploads an image via the Gradio interface.  
2. **Caption Generation**: The image is processed to generate an English caption using a BLIP-based model.  
3. **Arabic Translation**: The caption is translated to Arabic using a pre-trained translation model.  
4. **Audio Output**: Arabic captions are converted to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).  
5. **Question Suggestions**: The model generates suggested questions related to the image. Users can select or input custom questions.  
6. **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: The selected question is answered, and the answer is translated into Arabic.  
7. **Result Display**: Both the Arabic caption and the VQA answer are displayed.
